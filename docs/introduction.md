The goal of this project is to provide a small but realistic set of documents that multiple people can edit at the same time. Each change is made in a separate branch and is proposed through a pull request.

New contributors can use this repository to practice how to read existing documentation, decide what needs to be improved, and propose clear, focused updates.

This introduction has been updated as part of collaborative work.
